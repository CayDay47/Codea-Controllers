--- Controller
-- Base class for controllers
-- 
-- Controllers translate touch events into callbacks to functions
-- that do something in the app. (Model/View/Controller style).
-- 
-- Controllers can draw a representation of their current state on
-- the screen, but you can choose not to.
-- 
-- A controller can be installed as the global handler for touch
-- events by calling its activate() method

Controller = class()

function Controller:activate()
touched = function(t)
self:touched(t)
end
end

function Controller:draw()
-- nothing
end
